# Analysis of Spider-Circadian-Activity
The goal of this project is to understand pattern of locomotive behavior in spiders. Since our lab is interested in circadian control of locomotion, our main goal is to determine if the behavior responds to intrinsic "time of day" signal

## What is Circadian Rhythm?

The circadian rhythm is our internal biological clock. It regulates all of our physiological functionsâ€”from the sleep/wake cycle to signaling when to eat. In humans, our biological clock is found to be around 24.2 hours. In fact, most organisms on Earth has an internal clock that is around 24 hours because a day on Earth is 24 hours. In the event where our circadian clock is altered, physiological functions are reduced.

However, spiders are different. Not only do they have differing biological clocks, but they also have a wide range of clocks, from 19 to 30 hours. We wish to explore why this is and how they are able to live in a world where a day is 24 hours.

## Required Files

A .csv file with columns for every spider labeled s1, s2, s3... etc. Rows are times and dates when data is recorded. Cells are filled with the number of times the spider moved by crossing an infrared beam.
