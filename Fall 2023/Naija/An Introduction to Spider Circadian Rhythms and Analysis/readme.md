# An Introduction to Spider Circadian Rhythms and Analysis
## Fall 2023 Research Experience in the Toporikova Lab, Washington & Lee University
Naija Barakat ('24), Neuroscience Department
## About the Project
This semester I worked under Dr. Natalia Toporikova. Her lab's current focus is novel work involving measuring, analyzing, and understanding the circadian rhythms of spiders, namely *Parasteadoda*, a common house spider, and *Steatoda*, false Black Widow. 

During my time in the lab, I: 
- learned about circadian rhythms of Drosophilia melanogaster and spiders, including current gaps in research
- learned how circadian research is conducted and data is produced
- completed first-pass processing and visualization of circadian rhythm data
