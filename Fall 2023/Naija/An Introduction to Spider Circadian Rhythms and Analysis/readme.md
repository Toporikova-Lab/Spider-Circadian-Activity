# An Introduction to Spider Circadian Rhythms and Analysis
## Fall 2023 Research Experience in the Toporikova Lab, Washington & Lee University
*Naija Barakat ('24), Neuroscience Department*

## About the Project
This semester I worked under Dr. Natalia Toporikova. Her lab's current focus is novel work involving measuring, analyzing, and understanding the circadian rhythms of spiders, namely *Parasteadoda*, common house spider, and *Steatoda*, false Black Widow. 

During my time in the lab, I: 
- learned about circadian rhythms of *Drosophilia melanogaster* and spiders, including current gaps in research
- learned how circadian research is conducted and data is produced
- completed first-pass processing and visualization of circadian rhythm data

## Background on Circadian Rhythms
A circadian rhythm is a biological cycle comprised of synchronized biochemical, physiological, and behavioral changes throughout a roughly 24-hour period. This cycle allows organisms with circadian rhythms to remain in sync with its environment and respond to environmental changes, such as temperature and light. Circadian rhythms are thought to be highly conserved and nearly ubiquitous across eukaryotes, demonstrative of the advantage circadian rhythms provide to the organism and its biological fitness. 
  
Despite the importance of biological synchronization with the environment, some species of spiders have been found to have much shorter circadian rhythms, as short as 18.7 h (Mah et al., 2020), while not suffering from any apparent losses in fitness or suitability to their environment. Research on spider circadian rhythms remains limited in number, leaving questions about mutability of typical length of the circadian clock and the plasticity of shorter or longer circadian clocks, unanswered. 

## Circadian Rhythm Research & Data
Circadian rhythms can be studied by analyizing biochemical changes, such as changes in gene expression or hormone levels, or by studying behavior. In behavioral examination of circadian rhythms, reproduction, feeding, social activities, or locomotion can be observed and analyzed to determine normal rhythms or how these behaviors can be entrained. Entrainment is synchronization of the endogenous circadian rhythm with environmental cues. In the Toporikova lab, the entrainment to red light of *Parasteadoda* and *Steatoda*, is studied through measuring locomotion.
