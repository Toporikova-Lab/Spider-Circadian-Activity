This subfolder is intended to share and organize our lab research on spider locomotor activity in the Summer of 2023. Please create your own sub-folder in .../Individual Folders and push all the code you have developed in this repository. We will be using this repo to share and discuss our code, so make sure to organize your individual scripts. No other code format (email, download to box, etc) would be accepted for this research project. If I do not see your updated code on GitHub, I assume that you did not develop any.
