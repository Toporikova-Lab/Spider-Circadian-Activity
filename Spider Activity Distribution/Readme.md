The project contains analysis is to develop a code which calculate activity onset of spider locomotor activity after transfer from light to a dart. We are using recording from activity monitor in LD 12:12 condition (that is 12 hours of light and 12 hours of dark) from multiple species. The goal of this analysis is to understand the distribution of activity onset among spider species and relationship between activity onset and free-running period
